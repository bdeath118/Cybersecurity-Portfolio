// This file can be used for any global initialization logic
// that needs to run once when the application starts.

// Example: Initialize a global logger or error tracking
// import { initLogger } from './logger';
// initLogger();

// Example: Set up global configurations
// import { setGlobalConfig } from './config';
// setGlobalConfig({ theme: 'dark', analytics: true });

// This file is intentionally left mostly empty as its purpose
// is highly application-specific.
// It's a good place for side effects that need to happen once.

console.log("Application initialization script loaded.")

// You might import and call functions here that set up global state
// or perform one-time checks.
// For instance, if you had a client-side Supabase client that needed
// to be initialized once, you might do it here if it's not handled
// by a React context provider.
